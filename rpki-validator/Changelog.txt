* Mon Nov 16 2020 Ties de Kock <tdekock@ripe.net> - 3.2

**New minor release due to change in validation behaviour.**

- Use strict validation (`rpki.validator.strict-validation=true`) by default,
  with minor differences from [draft-ietf-sidrops-6486bis-00](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-sidrops-6486bis-00.txt).
- Use case insensitive URI schemes in object validations.
- Validate that RPKI repository object was found at the correct location.
- Stricter checking of certificate Subject and Issuer DN.
- Decrease bootstrap time by checking rsync repositories earlier after they
  are first encountered, and by triggering revalidation when needed.
- Fix Docker tag creation during the release.
- Add docker image for rtr server.

* Fri Sep 18 2020 Mikhail Puzanov <mpuzanov@ripe.net> - 3.1
- Remove repositories from the cache if they are not referred by any certificate for long enough.
- Make 'strict mode' enabled by `rpki.validator.strict-validation=true` more compliant with RFC 6486bis.
- Multiple changes for improving parallel execution and fix potential deadlock.
- Improvements in CPU and memory usage.
- Improvements in storing ROAs in the cache to save space for big ROA objects.

* Thu Aug 20 2020 Mikhail Puzanov <mpuzanov@ripe.net> - 3.1
- Revert changes related to RRDP parallel processing to avoid potential deadlock. This also reverts
  all memory and metrics changes introduced in the previous release.

* Thu Aug 6 2020 Ties de Kock <tdekock@ripe.net> - 3.1
- Multiple performance improvements, about 25% less CPU usage.
- Multiple improvements in memory consumption, the validator is able to comfortably work with setting
  `jvm.mem.maximum=768m` or even 512m.
- Fixes in rpki-rtr-server shell script to prevent startup failures.
- Added detailed metric for rrdp status (e.g. invalid responses): `rpkivalidator_rrdp_status_total`

* Mon Jul 6 2020 Mikhail Puzanov <mpuzanov@ripe.net> - 3.1
- Introduce property `rpki.validator.strict-validation` enabling strict validation, i.e. manifest
  and CRL warnings will now be considered errors. Set to false by default.
- Introduce property `rpki.validator.rsync-only` mainly for testing and research purposed.
  Set to false by default.
- Support HTTPS URL for trust anchor certificates in TAL files, falling back to rsync if needed.
- Fix Happy Eyeballs DNS resolver that could cause lots of stray threads CPU-consuming in some situations.
- Do no trust all the HTTPS certificates by default when downloading data using RRDP.

* Wed Jun 24 2020 Ties de Kock <tdekock@ripe.net> 3.1
- Breaking: Rename prometheus metrics to follow naming standards. Validator
metrics start with `rpkivalidator`, rtr server metrics start with `rtrserver`.
- Add metric for active rtr connections.

* Fri May 22 2020 Ties de Kock <tdekock@ripe.net> 3.1-2020.05.22.11.25
Security update: Changed permissions for CentOS systemd service files

After a change in our build infrastructure, the CentOS (rpm) artifact contained
world-writable systemd service files that would allow users with write access
to the machine to elevate privileges and get local code execution.

Version affected: CentOS build of 3.1-2020.05.08.09.26.49
Other releases and builds were not affected.

- Packaging changes for Debian and Centos.
- Add endpoint that applies SLURM-based VRPs to extended export and fix a broken link.
- Fix NullPointerException when managing ignore filters with only ASN or prefix and not both.
- Reduce CPU usage for top-down tree validation for TA with a lot of delegated CAs.
- Fix priority of configuration properties.
- Update Docker image

* Fri May 8 2020 Mikhail Puzanov <mpuzanovg@ripe.net> - 3.1
- Add SLURM-based VRPs to export.json

* Mon Mar 16 2020 Ties de Kock <tdekock@ripe.net> - 3.1

  and use Xodus https://github.com/JetBrains/xodus as persistence instead.
- Improve responsiveness, set default RPKI object clean up grace period to 48 hours (used to be 7 days).
- Store all the ignore filters and white lists in a slurm.json file instead of the database, so now
  the database can be deleted any time without losing any user-configured data.
- For migration, the content of the 'db' directory should be remove and export and re-import of SLURM is required.
