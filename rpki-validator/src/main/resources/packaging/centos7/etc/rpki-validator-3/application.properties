# This is the port for the API, health checks, and future UI
#
# Note that we do not recommend exposing this externally. If you must,
# then we recommend that an HTTPS proxy is used, and access is restricted
#
# You can find an example config here:
# https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/rpki-validator-3/wiki/Run-the-RPKI-Validator-behind-an-apache-proxy
server.port=8080

# By default the validator will listen on ALL interfaces. 
# Most users will expect this behavior, and find that it's easiest when
# deploying the validator in a docker container.
# You may however wish to uncomment the following line to have the
# validator bind to localhost only.
#server.address=127.0.0.1

# Use the following settings to change JVM parameters
#
# Change the initial and maximum memory for the JVM
#
# Notes:
# - 512 megabytes of memory is needed for the current size of the combined RPKI repositories
# - You may want to raise this value if you see 'out of memory' errors in the log
# - A higher maximum will allow the JVM to use more system memory and spend less time on
#   garbage collection (slight speed improvements possible)
jvm.memory.initial=512m       # -Xms jvm option -> initial memory claimed by the jvm
jvm.memory.maximum=512m       # -Xmx jvm option -> maximum memory for the jvm
