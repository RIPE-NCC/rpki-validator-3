# Note that we do not recommend exposing this externally. If you must,

# You can find an example config here:

# By default the validator will listen on localhost ONLY

# You can change this behavior by uncommenting the following line in

# specifying a different IP address
server.address=localhost

# Change the initial and maximum memory for the JVM.
# Normally the default settings should be sufficient.
#
# Notes:
# - 1536 megabytes of memory is needed for the current size of the combined RPKI repositories
#   and BGP tables
# - You may want to raise this value if you see 'out of memory' errors in the log
# - A higher maximum will allow the JVM to use more system memory and spend less time on
#   garbage collection (slight speed improvements possible)
# jvm.mem.initial=1024m       # -Xms jvm option -> initial memory claimed by the jvm
# jvm.mem.maximum=1536m       # -Xmx jvm option -> maximum memory for the jvm
