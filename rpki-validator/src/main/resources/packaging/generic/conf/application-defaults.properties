# Use the following settings to change JVM parameters
#
# Change the initial and maximum memory for the JVM
#
# Notes:
# - 1536 megabytes of memory is needed for the current size of the combined RPKI repositories
#   and BGP tables
# - You may want to raise this value if you see 'out of memory' errors in the log
# - A higher maximum will allow the JVM to use more system memory and spend less time on
#   garbage collection (slight speed improvements possible)
jvm.mem.initial=1024m       # -Xms jvm option -> initial memory claimed by the jvm
jvm.mem.maximum=1536m       # -Xmx jvm option -> maximum memory for the jvm
