# Use the following settings to change JVM parameters
#
# Change the initial and maximum memory for the JVM
#
# Notes:
# - 768 megabytes of memory is needed for the current size of the combined RPKI repositories
#   and BGP tables
# - You may want to raise this value if you see 'out of memory' errors in the log
# - A higher maximum will allow the JVM to use more system memory and spend less time on
#   garbage collection (slight speed improvements possible)
jvm.memory.initial=768m       # -Xms jvm option -> initial memory claimed by the jvm
jvm.memory.maximum=768m       # -Xmx jvm option -> maximum memory for the jvm

# The following directive is used to set where preconfigured TALs that ship with
